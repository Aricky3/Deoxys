                <h3>What is Mirror box therapy?</h3>
                <p>Mirror box therapy is a treatment technique typically used for patients experiencing phantom limb
                    pain, motor recovery after stroke, or other rehabilitation needs. The method involves a box with a
                    mirror placed in the center. The patient places the intact limb within one side of the box and then
                    moves it; the reflection creates the illusion of a complete, healthy limb, which can “trick” the
                    brain to help alleviate pain and help with recovery.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Current Problems</h3>
                <p>Despite its effectiveness, traditional mirror box therapy has limitations. The main issue is the need
                    for regular in-person sessions with a healthcare provider, which can be challenging for patients
                    with busy schedules, mobility issues, or geographical limitations. Further, the nature of the mirror
                    box limits the range of motion and comfort of the therapy at the time of therapy.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Our Product/Solution: Virtual Reality Mirror Therapy</h3>
                <p>Our solution tackles these problems head-on by introducing Virtual Reality (VR) into mirror box
                    therapy. Our product is a virtual reality mirror therapy application that can be used at home or any
                    convenient location, using a VR headset.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Here's how our product helps to address the current problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Our VR solution allows patients to undergo therapy sessions no
                        matter where they are. It reduces the need for regular, in-person visits to healthcare
                        providers, making it especially useful for those with irregular work schedules or limited
                        mobility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Traditional mirror therapy relies heavily on the patient's ability
                        to "imagine" the movement of the absent or affected limb. Our VR solution can visually replicate
                        the limb in various environments and contexts, increasing immersiveness, patient engagement and
                        potentially boosting how effective the therapy can be.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> Our product can be tailored to each patient's specific needs,
                        allowing for personalized therapy sessions. The VR program can be adjusted to the user’s or the
                        clinician’s preferences to boost how effective the therapy can be.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <div class="panel panel-ditto1">
                        <p>
                            The expert we discussed with was Brennan Marshall, a 3rd year medical student at UCSD Health and works
                            at the simulation center. He has a background in the intersection between computer science and medicine,
                            which gives him an avid understanding in this field. He has developed a mirror therapy app on iOS but
                            this inherently limits the user's experience since they are bound to the 2D device, making it less
                            user-friendly.
    
                            We followed a semi-structured interview process for our feedback session. Since our prototype was a 3D
                            application, we recorded a video showing what it would look like. We shared this video with our expert
                            at the very beginning of our feedback session, and asked questions about it afterwards. The expert
                            brought up many points that were interesting and relevant to our prototype, so we ended up diverging
                            rather far from our initial interview questions, but circled back towards them at the end of the
                            feedback session.
    
                            The main feedback points we received are listed below:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mirrored limb has to be very realistic.</li>
                            <li>He suggested a scanning method, where real time image processing is used to mirror limbs</li>
                            <li>He suggested that hand tracking can be used to inform the image processing</li>
                            <li>Something as simple as the lack of a tattoo (or an extra tattoo) can render the therapy less
                                effective, so realism should be a priority.</li>
                            <li>A normal VR avatar would not be sufficient.</li>
                            <li>The convenience of the setup will be the main driver for user use, and a complex PC-connected sort
                                of setup might end up an interesting project but with nobody using it</li>
                            <li>AR is not feasible for this project, because users will be able to see their lack of a limb clearly,
                                breaking the therapy. </li>
                            <li>We need an easier and more intuitive interface to pick out missing limb </li>
                            <li>Another large benefit of this would be data collection for researchers and clinicians</li>
                            <li>We could use other devices to remind the user to do the therapy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            From the feedback, the main takeaways that we applied were:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A diagram for users to pick which limb is missing </li>
                            <li>Scanning the users limb that they wish to do mirror therapy in order to effectively and accurately
                                reproduce limb</li>
                            <li>Guided sessions within the app for ease of use</li>
                            <li>Notifications on a smartphone or connected smart watch to remind the user to check in</li>
                            <li>Interface for researchers and clinicians to access the session data of the users</li>
                            <li>Making sure the environment is as realistic as possible</li>
                        </ul>

                            After conducting our expert feedback session, we realized how important it was to not break the experience for the user. Even a missing tattoo, or a tattoo present where none had been before, could break the immersion and ruin the effectiveness of the therapy. Current AR technology would let the user see their affected limbs, and break the immersion.
